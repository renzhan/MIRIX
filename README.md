### Key Features 🔥

- **Multi-Agent Memory System:** Six specialized memory components (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, Knowledge Vault) managed by dedicated agents
- **Screen Activity Tracking:** Continuous visual data capture and intelligent consolidation into structured memories  
- **Privacy-First Design:** All long-term data stored locally with user-controlled privacy settings
- **Advanced Search:** PostgreSQL-native BM25 full-text search with vector similarity support
- **Multi-Modal Input:** Text, images, voice, and screen captures processed seamlessly

### Quick Start
**Step 1: Backend & Dashboard (Docker):**
```
docker compose up -d --pull always
```
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5173  
- API: http://localhost:8531  

**Step 2: Create an API key in the dashboard (http://localhost:5173) and set as the environmental variable.**

**Step 3: Client (Python, `mirix-client`, https://pypi.org/project/mirix-client/):**
```
pip install mirix-client
```

Now you are ready to go! See the example below:
```python
from mirix import MirixClient

client = MirixClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:8531",
)

meta = client.initialize_meta_agent(
    config={"llm_config": {"model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}}
)

resp = client.add(
    user_id="demo-user",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "The moon now has a president."}]},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Noted."}]},
    ],
)
print(resp)

memories = client.retrieve_with_conversation(
    user_id="demo-user",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What did we discuss on MirixDB in last 4 days?"}]},
    ],
    limit=5,
)
print(memories)
```
